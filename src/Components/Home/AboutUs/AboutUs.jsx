        <h4>Enhancing the Lives of Communities</h4>
        <p>
          At Teens With Vision, we believe that children are the very essence of
          the future. Who they are tomorrow is essentially the outcome of how
          they are raised and nurtured today. As voluntary association which is
          founded by two young smart minds Boipelo Mosoma and Neo Cholo,our
          goals are to shape the way our community live their lives and teach
          them the fundamentals of social responsibility, healthy living and
          cultural acceptance. Curious to find out more about us and how you can
          get involved? Browse our website and get in touch with us today.
